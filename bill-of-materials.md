# Bill of materials (BOM)

Everything that you need to build your buzzers and replicate this project.

We aim to categorize the materials per component.
The links are just for showcase reasons and might not link to the cheapest shops.
Please do your research depending on your country of living where to buy the materials best.

PS: If you don't own everything yourself (like more expensive equipment like a 3D printer, you can reach out to a local [Hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) or a [Fab lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab) in your area.

## General equipment

Things you need in general:

* A Soldering iron and solder
* Fine mechanics tooling to work with electronic components (e.g., cables, resistor)
* A 3D printer

## Buzzer

This list of materials is to build one buzzer.
Please multiply it according to the number of buzzers you want to build.

* Print material for a 3D printer in a color of your choice (the button case)
* The buzzer itself (e.g., on [ebay germany](https://www.ebay.de/itm/100mm-Selbstruck-Convex-Taster-Spiel-Vending-Machine-Control-Microswitch/182433206826?hash=item2a79ddd22a:g:xBYAAOSwlx9cLb5Y) or [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32757761221.html?spm=a2g1y.12024536.productList_117902197.pic_9)) - Make sure that they are 100mm big and not the small arcade buttons
* [A USB male connector](https://www.amazon.com/USB-Connector-Conwork-Straight-Replacement/dp/B072MCHX41?th=1)
* [Breadboard jumper wires](https://www.amazon.com/Foxnovo-Breadboard-Jumper-Wires-Female/dp/B00PBZMN7C/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=jumper+wired+cable&qid=1567943470&s=gateway&sr=8-4)
* [Pin header connectors](https://www.amazon.com/Glarks-Connector-Assortment-Stackable-Breakaway/dp/B07CWSXY7P/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=connector+pins&qid=1567943511&s=gateway&sr=8-10)
* A small piece of a [circuit board](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Universal-Printed-Circuit-Soldering/dp/B07FK6TDD5/ref=sr_1_20_sspa?keywords=circuit+board&qid=1567943631&s=gateway&sr=8-20-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExRkNFVVhQN1BFU0xEJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTU4NDcyMVNNNllNSExRWFJWMiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTc0NTAxMkEwVEJQWFFETU1HWSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) (to cut and solder)
* Three small screws

## Raspberry Pi hat

The Pi hat is only needed and built once (for four buzzers).

PS: The itself (without components on it) is fully designed at [our EasyEDA project](https://easyeda.com/derebbe/RPI-4Button-LED-HUB) and can be ordered from there. By this, you don't have to connect the components by yourself, only add them onto the board.

* A [circuit board](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Universal-Printed-Circuit-Soldering/dp/B07FK6TDD5/ref=sr_1_20_sspa?keywords=circuit+board&qid=1567943631&s=gateway&sr=8-20-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExRkNFVVhQN1BFU0xEJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTU4NDcyMVNNNllNSExRWFJWMiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTc0NTAxMkEwVEJQWFFETU1HWSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX210ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) (to cut and solder)
* 4 x [USB male connector](https://www.amazon.com/USB-Connector-Conwork-Straight-Replacement/dp/B072MCHX41?th=1)
* 4 x resistor 100Ω
* 4 x resistor 10KΩ
* 4 x resistor 470Ω
* 4 x transistor npn (BJT)
* 1 x male 2x20 [Pin Headers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074HVBTZ4/ref=psdc_172544_t2_B07CWSXY7P)
* 1 x female 2x20 [Pin Headers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074HVBTZ4/ref=psdc_172544_t2_B07CWSXY7P)
* 1 x male 1x4 [Pin Headers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074HVBTZ4/ref=psdc_172544_t2_B07CWSXY7P)

## Miscellaneous

* A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (or a newer one with the same layout)
* 5m USB 2.0 cables (don't need to be the best quality when it comes to data transfer speed, we only use USB for convenience reasons and to transfer the push signal)
